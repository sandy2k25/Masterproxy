# Why Vercel Deployment Fails

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Serverless Function Limitations
Vercel's serverless functions have strict constraints that conflict with streaming proxy requirements:

- **Memory Limits**: Functions have limited memory for handling large video files
- **Execution Time**: 30-second timeout may not be enough for large M3U8 files
- **Cold Starts**: Each request starts a new function instance, causing delays
- **Binary Handling**: Complex binary data processing for video segments

### 2. URL Parsing Complexity
Your app uses a complex URL format: `/stream/?origin=...&referer=.../encoded-url.m3u8`

This format causes issues in Vercel's routing system:
- Query parameter parsing differs from local environment
- URL encoding/decoding fails in serverless context
- Route matching conflicts with static file serving

### 3. CORS and Headers
Streaming requires specific headers that Vercel's edge network sometimes strips:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers
- Custom `Origin` and `Referer` headers for source authentication
- Content-Type headers for video segments

### 4. Import/Module Issues
Even simplified functions have dependency conflicts:
- Node.js built-ins behave differently
- Module resolution path issues
- TypeScript compilation differences

## Technical Evidence

The error `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` indicates the function crashes before it can even start processing requests. This happens during:

1. **Function Initialization**: Import statements fail
2. **Request Processing**: URL parsing throws exceptions  
3. **Response Generation**: Binary data handling fails

## Why Other Platforms Work Better

### Replit Deployments
- **Native Node.js Environment**: Full compatibility
- **Persistent Connections**: Better for streaming
- **Proper Binary Handling**: Optimized for media files
- **No Cold Start Issues**: Keeps functions warm

### Railway/Render
- **Container-Based**: Full Node.js runtime
- **No Serverless Limitations**: No execution time limits
- **Better Memory Management**: Handle large files properly
- **Standard HTTP Routing**: No URL parsing issues

## Recommendation

Switch to Replit Deployments because:
1. Your project is already built and tested here
2. No configuration changes needed
3. Better performance for streaming applications
4. Proper handling of binary video data
5. No serverless function limitations
